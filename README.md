# Welcome to My Portfolio! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»

This repository serves as a portfolio where I showcase the projects and assignments I've worked on during my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Minho. It's a collection of everything I've been involved in academically, from small exercises to larger team-based projects.

You'll find a variety of projects hereâ€”some fully completed, others still a work in progress. While there are areas that could use some polishing, I'm committed to revisiting and improving them in the future as I continue to grow and refine my skills. ðŸš€

A special shoutout to my teammates, as many of these projects were the result of great teamwork and collaboration. Their efforts and creativity played a huge role in bringing these ideas to life! ðŸ™Œ

Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to feedback and excited to learn more!
